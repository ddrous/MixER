Epilepsy2 dataset contains single-channel EEG measurements from 500 subjects. Data originally from [1] https://repositori.upf.edu/handle/10230/42894
and formatted in [2]
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/TF-C_Pretrain_Epilepsy/19930199</p>

<p> For each subject, the brain activity was recorded for 23.6 seconds. The dataset was then divided and shuffled (to mitigate sample-subject
association) into 11,500 samples of 1 second each, sampled at 178 Hz.</p> 

<p> The data was split into 60 train, 20 validation and 11420 test cases. We have added the validation set to the end of the train file to ease reproduction if a validation set is needed. The train set was made very small to help evaluate transfer learning. We retain the same distribution.</p>

<p> The raw dataset features 5 different classification labels corresponding to
different status of the subject or location of measurement - eyes open,
eyes closed, EEG measured in healthy brain region, EEG measured
where the tumor was located, and, finally, the subject experiencing seizure
episode. This was converted into a binary classification problem in p [2]
by merging the first 4 classes into one and each time series sample has a binary label describing if the associated
subject is experiencing seizure or not. The train data is balanced with 40 siezure and 40 non-seizure. The test data is unbalanced.

<p>
<ol>
<li> seizure (test 19.79%)
<li> no seizure (test 80.21%)
</ol>

<p> For reference, the Mini Rocket classifier achieves 96.25% test accuracy.
